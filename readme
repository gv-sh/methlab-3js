methlab-3js
===========

The mETHLAB is an ambitious project that leverages the power of threeJS to create a visually stunning and interactive 3D world. Users are introduced to a multi-level environment, each with its own unique purpose and challenges. The narrative unfolds as users progress through these levels, immersing them in a story where they can engage with the world of mETH, reminiscent of the iconic Breaking Bad series.
